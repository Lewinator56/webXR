# Mobile AR Requirements Specification

## Task Outline
You are required to built a Web-based AR application that displays environmental data, superimposed either on an AR marker, or a specific geolocation (lat + long) around Bangor1. The environmental data can be imaginary, presented in the form of 3D objects (bar-charts, floating panels, etc.). If you use geolocation information, it must be real, and correspond to known landmark locations (such as University locations - you may use Google Maps to obtain those)

## Requirements
- Web based augmented reality system that can display data at specific locations based on the user's location and camera direction
- built using three.JS, AFrame and PHP for the backend
- ability to track device position, pitch and yaw
- based on inputs from device, identify AR objects that are within the viewport
- Easy ability to add/edit/remove ed objects using a PHP and MySQL backend
-
