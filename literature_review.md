# Mobile AR literature review

## AR on mobile devices
- Y. -C. Cheng et al., "AR-Based Positioning for Mobile Devices," 2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops, 2011, pp. 63-70, doi: 10.1109/ICPPW.2011.48.
    -  Outlines techniques that can be used to greatly increase the accuracy of position detection for AR applications on mobile devices, identifying the shortfalls in (albeit) 2011 portable positional tracking hardware. Notably it identifies how the orientation of the device, camera focal length and other image data can be used to increase the accuracy of objects placed in the envirnmnet in AR.
    -  This paper does not deal with video however, and only identifies processing techniques that can be used for fixed images. The coarse positioning system outlined does however provide some useful insight into increasing the accuracy of AR objects.

    - This paper describes the current and potential applications for mobile augmented reality as well as identifying the ways a user can interract with systems deployed on these devices. The paper also discusses frameworks that can be used for developing AR applications as well as hardware and software considerations that need to be made during development.
