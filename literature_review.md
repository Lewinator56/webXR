# Mobile AR literature review

## AR on mobile devices
- Y. -C. Cheng et al., "AR-Based Positioning for Mobile Devices," 2011 40th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops, 2011, pp. 63-70, doi: 10.1109/ICPPW.2011.48.
    -  Outlines techniques that can be used to greatly increase the accuracy of position detection for AR applications on mobile devices, identifying the shortfalls in (albeit) 2011 portable positional tracking hardware. Notably it identifies how the orientation of the device, camera focal length and other image data can be used to increase the accuracy of objects placed in the envirnmnet in AR.
    -  This paper does not deal with video however, and only identifies processing techniques that can be used for fixed images. The coarse positioning system outlined does however provide some useful insight into increasing the accuracy of AR objects.

    - This paper describes the current and potential applications for mobile augmented reality as well as identifying the ways a user can interract with systems deployed on these devices. The paper also discusses frameworks that can be used for developing AR applications as well as hardware and software considerations that need to be made during development.

    - This is a fairly in depth paper (though a bit old now) discussing the developemnts leading up toe mobile AR and discussing implementations at the time of writing. It discusses some of the challanges (some are still relevant) for mobile AR, such as tracking, and some potential areas where mobile AR could be very useful, such as ubiquitous computing. It also identifies challanges for outdoor augmented reality, though most of those identified have now been solved due to modern hardware. As with other papers it also briefly discusses areas where there are still issues, such as user interraction and screen space usage.

## Mobile AR UX
- M. B. Carmo, A. P. Afonso, A. Ferreira, A. P. Cláudio and G. Silva, "PoI Awareness, Relevance and Aggregation for Augmented Reality," 2016 20th International Conference Information Visualisation (IV), 2016, pp. 300-305, doi: 10.1109/IV.2016.47.
    - This paper discusses the methods for mapping points of interest and identifying them within the limited field of view of a mobile device's camera (and screen). It identifies some of the issues where there may be many points of interest within a given location, and how this can be solved. It discusses how the importance or relevance of POIs can be shown using colours and aggregation. It also shows a simple implementation showing how the techniques discussed can be used to make the UX for a mobile AR application better.

    - This paper discusses the challanges with tracking in AR where there is a one-to-one relationship between objects that are virtual, and real world points of interest using GIS databases. It discusses techniques for overlaying the virtual objects in the correct places, these techniques being marker-less, and either implemeted with computer vision or through camera pose estimation (through an arrya of implementations). The advantages and drawbacks of the techniques are discussed as well as implementation information. It also discusses techniques for giving the user information about locations, such as providing links to external data or 3d visualisation. 

## AR Applications
- Kamel Boulos, M.N., Lu, Z., Guerrero, P. et al. From urban planning and emergency training to Pokémon Go: applications of virtual reality GIS (VRGIS) and augmented reality GIS (ARGIS) in personal, public and environmental health. Int J Health Geogr 16, 7 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-017-0081-0
    - This paper is more of a discuission about current and future use cases for AR on mobile devices. one such application discusses is 'smart cities', while it focuses on uses cases such as public health or planning, the concept can be applied to the application for this project. As with other outdoor AR applications, it discusses the use of GIS as an important tool for identifying areas and locations in the real world to be used in the virtual world shown to the user. It also discusses some of the issues with GIS based augmented reality.
